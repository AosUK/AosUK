

data structure thing: 
    Set of closed cells, with 2 values, a max and min number of mines in it



begin with a set for each numbered cell:
    a '4' with 6 closed cells around it would create a set of those 6 cells
    both the max and min values are set to 4 since the number tells us this exactly.


the goal:
    reduce / split these sets to have either:
        the min number of mines be equal to the number of cells: they are all mines
        the max number of mines be 0: they are all safe



for every set:   
    compare with every other set:      lets label them A and be
        if B is a subset of A  (test if intersection is equal size to B)
        then we can split A into 2 sets
        1, B: we already have this so it is deleted
        2, the cells not in B:
            every mine that we knew for sure was in B can not be in this new set
            therefore:
